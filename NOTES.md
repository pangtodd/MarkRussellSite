## Notes
* Currently in the planning stages, look at the following sites for inspiration/templates:
  *   [Chip Zdarsky](http://www.zdars.co/) Leaning towards using this as a template in terms of what content to include and how he links to his store/blog/books.
  *   [Phillip Kennedy Johnson](https://www.phillipkennedyjohnson.com/) Laid out better than #1.
  *   [Kieron Gillen](https://kierongillen.com/) Pretty basic, I think we can match/do better.
*  [Big Cartel](https://www.bigcartel.com/examples) seems to be the best option for selling items on line- it's free if there are 5 items or less for sale. 
* for press section, include the following:
