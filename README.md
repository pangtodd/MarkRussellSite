## Description: website for author client

Website for author- they weren't quite sure what they wanted, so I researched a few other sites of other comic book authors. I came up with the initial design, and at the author's request, I added a "coming soon" section. I wanted to give him the ability to update his own site, so I ended up using an iFrame linked to a google slide that he could adjust himself.
